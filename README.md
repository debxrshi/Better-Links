				# BetterLinks

## Description
BetterLinks is an Obsidian plugin designed to enhance your note-taking experience. It automatically detects links in a note and formats them with the titles of the pages or videos of those links. It also generates previews of the links, providing a quick snapshot of the linked content without leaving your note.

## Features
- **Automatic Link Detection**: The plugin automatically detects any links in your notes.
- **Link Formatting**: Formats detected links with the titles of the pages or videos, providing more context and making your notes more readable.
- **Link Previews**: Generates previews of the links, allowing you to get a glimpse of the linked content without having to navigate away from your note.

## Installation
1. Go to **Community Plugins** in Obsidian's settings.
2. Disable **Safe Mode**.
3. Click on **Browse**, search for "BetterLinks", and click on **Install**.
4. Once installed, activate the plugin by toggling it in the **Community Plugins** tab.

## Usage
